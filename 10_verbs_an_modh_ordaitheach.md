# Verbs - An Modh Ordaitheach


_An Modh Ordaitheach_ is the Imperative, i.e. what you use to give an order
(Go!, Do!, etc).

The root of the verb is what you find in a dictionary. All forms of a verb come
from the root. The Imperative has two forms, second person singular, which is
always just the same as the Root, and second person plural, which is formed
depending on the verb conjugation.

There are two conjugations of verbs in Irish:


### First conjugation (*An chéad réimniú*)

Monosyllabic verbs like _bris_, _mol_ and _suigh_ and polysyllabic verbs that
end with _-áil_ and _-áin_ like _sábháil_ and _taispeáin_.


### Second conjugation (*An dara réimniú*)

Other polysyllabic verbs. Many of them end with _-igh_ like _ceannaigh_, and
some others end with _-il_, _-ir_ and _-is_, like _ceangail_, _imir_ and _inis_.


## The first conjugation

The second person singular is just the root.

The second person plural is formed depending on the verb.

Most are formed by adding _-igí_ or _-aigí_ to the root

| First person singular | First person plural |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| bris                  | brisigí             |
| tóg                   | tógaigí             |

If the verb ends in _-áil_ or _-áin_, broaden the l or n, and add _-aigí_

| First person singular | First person plural |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| marcáil               | marcálaigí          |
| taispeáin             | taispeánaigí        |

For verbs like _dóigh_ and _léigh_ that have a fada vowel, lose the _-igh_ and
add _-igí_

| First person singular | First person plural |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| dóigh                 | dóigí               |
| léigh                 | léigí               |

For verbs like nigh and suigh, that have a non-fada vowel, lose the _-igh_ and
add _-ígí_

| First person singular | First person plural |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| nigh                  | nígí                |
| suigh                 | suígí               |


## The second conjugation

The second person singular is just the root.

The second person plural is formed depending on the verb.

For polysyllabic verbs that end with _-igh_, remove _-igh_ and add _-ígí_.

| First person singular | First person plural |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| ceannaigh             | ceannaígí           |
| éirigh                | éirígí              |

For polysyllabic verbs that end with _-il_, _-in_, _-ir_ and _-is_, remove the
last diphthong from the root and add either _-ígí_ or _-aígí_, according to
broad/slender.

| First person singular | First person plural |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| ceangail              | ceanglaígí          |
| imir                  | imrígí              |
| inis                  | insígí              |


## The Negative

Put _ná_ in front of the verb. Put a _h_ at the start of the verb if it starts
with a vowel.

* _Ná bris é!_
* _Ná habair liom go bhfuil sé ar ais_
* _Ná himrígí peil ar an bpríomhbhóthar_
