# Parts of speech


Consider the following English sentence:

_He hit the tennis ball firmly with a blue racket_.

A _noun_ is a person, place or thing. _Tennis_, _ball_ and _racket_ are nouns.
_Ainmfhocal_ is the Irish word for _noun_ (it literally means "name-word").

A _pronoun_ is a word used in place of a noun, often referring to a previously
used noun. _He_ is a pronoun. _Forainm_ is the Irish word for _pronoun_.

An _adjective_ is a word that describes a noun. _Blue_ is an adjective.
_Aidiacht_ is the Irish word for _adjective_. Note that, despite the fact that
the word _tennis_ does describe the ball, it is not an adjective, but a noun in
the genitive case (we'll get to this later).

A _verb_ is a word which indicates an action (a 'doing word'). _Hit_ is a verb.
_Briathar_ is the Irish word for _verb_.

An _adverb_ is a word describing a verb, usually indicating _how_ something is
done. _Firmly_ is an adverb. In English, most adverbs end with _-ly_. In Irish,
adverbs are usually _go_ followed by another word (e.g. _go maith_, _go tobann_,
_go deas_). _Dobhriathar_ is the Irish word for _adverb_.

A _preposition_ is a word that goes before a noun to modify or qualify a phrase.
_With_ is a preposition. Other examples of English prepositions are _at_, _by_,
_to_, _over_ & _for_. Some examples of Irish prepositions are _ag_, _ar_, _le_,
_roimh_ & _tar éis_. _Réamhfhocal_ is the Irish word for _preposition_.

An _article_ is a word that indicates whether a noun is _definite_ or
_indefinite_. In English, there are only two articles: _a_ (the indefinite
article) and _the_ (the definite article). In Irish, there is no indefinite
article, but there are two definite articles: _an_ and _na_. _Alt_ is the Irish
word for _article_.
