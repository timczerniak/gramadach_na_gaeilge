# Irish Grammar Reference


Many grammar courses/guides/websites focus on completeness, which can lead them
to be too technical and a bit daunting. This course trades instead focuses on
simplicity and memorability. As a result is not complete, and some finer points
are missing.

Note that the Gaeilge versions of grammatical terms are mentioned when
introducing a concept, but only the English terms are used throughout the rest
of the course.

Also note that the _Caighdeán Oifigiúil_ (Official Standard) is used here. I may
add dialectical bits later.
