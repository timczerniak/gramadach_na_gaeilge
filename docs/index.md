# Irish Grammar Course


Many grammar courses/guides/websites focus on completeness, which can lead them
to be too technical and a bit daunting. This course trades instead focuses on
simplicity and memorability of rules. As a result is not complete, and some
finer points are missing.

Note that the Gaeilge versions of grammatical terms are mentioned when
introducing a concept, but only the English terms are used throughout the rest
of the course.
