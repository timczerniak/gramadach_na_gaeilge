# Verbal Adjectives


Verbal adjectives (_aidiachtaí briathartha_) are the form of the verb that is
used to describe nouns (hence 'adjective').

They are equivalent to the past participle in English, e.g. done, gone, eaten.
But in Irish, they are not used as part of verbs, they are only used to describe
nouns:

* _Tá sé briste!_ (It is broken!)
* _An ceapaire ite_ (The eaten sandwich)
* _Lampa lasta_ (A lit lamp)


## Forming the Verbal Adjective

The verbal adjective is formed in several different ways, depending on the verb.

If a verb root ends in _-ch_, _-d_, _-l_, _-n_ or _-s_, add _-ta_ for broad and
_-te_ for slender

| Root (broad) | Verbal Adjective | Root (slender) | Verbal Adjective |
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| múch         | múchta           | sroich         | sroichte         |
| stad         | stadta           | goid           | goidte           |
| mol          | molta            | buail          | buailte          |
| líon         | líonta           | roinn          | roinnte          |
| las          | lasta            | bris           | briste           |

If a root ends with a slender _-th_, replace it with _-te_

| Root  | Verbal Adjective |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| caith | caite            |
| ith   | ite              |

If a monosyllabic root ends with _-igh_, replace it with _-te_

| Root   | Verbal Adjective                    |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| léigh  | léite                               |
| luaigh | luaite                              |
| faigh  | faighte (This is the one exception) |

If a verb root ends with _-b_, _-c_, _-g_, _-m_, _-p_ or _-r_, add _-tha_ for
broad and _-the_ for slender

| Root (broad) | Verbal Adjective | Root (slender) | Verbal Adjective |
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| scríob       | scríobtha        | stróic         | stróicthe        |
| íoc          | íoctha           | lig            | ligthe           |

| cum          | cumtha           | scaip          | scaipthe         |
| ceap         | ceaptha          | beir           | beirthe          |
| cíor         | cíortha          |                |                  |

Note that some verbs broaden their final consonant before _-t(h)a_

| Root      | Verbal Adjective |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| cuir      | curtha           |
| foghlaim  | foghlamtha       |
| siúil     | siúlta           |
| taispeáin | taispeánta       |

If a verb root is polysyllabic and ends in _-(a)igh_, replace the _-gh_ with
_-the_

| Root      | Verbal Adjective |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| ceannaigh | ceannaithe       |
| bailigh   | bailithe         |

If a verb root ends with _-t_, just add or _-a_ for broad and _-e_ for slender

| tacht        | tachta           | scoilt         | scoilte          |
| cleacht      | cleachta         | loit           | loite            |

## Verbal Adjectives vs. The Free Verb

Consider the English sentence 'The shop is closed'. It could have two meanings:

1. The shop is in a state of closure right now, i.e. it's not open.
2. Someone closes the shop regularly, e.g. 'The shop is closed at 5pm every day'

This is ambiguous in English. However, in Irish it is not. For the first
meaning, we use the verbal adjective, and for the second, we use the free verb
(_An briathar saor_, covered [here](10_the_free_verb.md)). The irish equivalents
of these would be:

1. _Tá an siopa dúnta_ - The shop is closed (i.e. right now it's not open)
2. _Dúntar an siopa_ - The shop is closed (perhaps at 5pm every day)
