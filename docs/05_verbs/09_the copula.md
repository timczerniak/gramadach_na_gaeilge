# Verbs: The Cupola

The Cupola (_An Chopail_) links two things together.

The Copula isn't strictly a verb (it's technically a particle), but it is here
because it is used in many places where a verb would be used in English.


## Uses of the Copula

A common question is "When should you use _tá_ and when should you use _is_".
A good way to think of it is:

* use _is_ (the copula) when you are saying **what** something is
* use _tá_ (the verb _bí_) for all other cases, i.e. where something is,
  how it is, what state it is in, what it is doing etc.

For example:

* _Is dochtúir mé_ (I am a doctor)
* _Is fear mé_ (I am a man)

But:

* _Táim fuar_ (I am cold)
* _Táim ag an bpictiúrlann_ (I am at the cinema)
* _Táim ag éisteacht_ (I am listening)

This is a good rule of thumb. But the cupola is complex, there are many
different situations where it is used.

A big feature of Irish is when the copula links a noun to an
adjective/preposition pair. There are many phrasings like this, but some
examples are _maith le_ (good with), _cóir do_ (right for), and _féidir le_
(possibility with).

* _Is maith liom ainmhithe_ ('I like animals', literally 'Animals are good with me')
* _Ba chóir duit codladh_ ('You should sleep', literally 'It would be right for you to sleep')
* _Is féidir léi scríobh_ ('She can write', literally 'Possibility is with her to write')

The Cupola can link one noun to another noun:

* _Is innealtóir mé_ (I am an engineer)
* _Ba dhochtúir é_ (He was a doctor)

It can link a prepositional phrase to a noun, or to a verbal phrase

* _Is as Corcaigh mé_ (I am from Cork)
* _Ba ar an mbord a bhí sé_ (It was on the table, literally 'It was on the table that it was')

It can link an adjective/noun phrase to a noun:

* _Is iontach an leabhar é sin_ (That is a wonderful book)

These are just some examples of its usage. As mentioned, it's complex and it
takes a while to get used to. For more examples, a good place to start is

## Forms of the Cupola

The base forms of the Cupola are in the table below.

|                   | Present    | Past and Conditional |
| ----------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| **positive**      | is         | ba / b'              |
| **negative**      | ní         | níor / níorbh        |
| **question**      | an         | ar / arbh            |
| **neg. question** | nach       | nár / nárbh          |
| **dependent**     | gur / gurb | gur / gurbh          |

You'll notice that the negative, question, negative question & dependent forms
echo what is put before verbs in each tense. There are two differences:

* In the Conditional tense, _ní_/_an_/_nach_/_go_ are used before verbs but the
  Conditional form of the cupola is _níor_/_ar_/_nár_/_gur_.
* _Gur_ is used in all dependent forms of the Copula.


## Present Tense Forms

No change happens to words following the present forms, apart from _ní_. 
The pronouns _é_, _í_, _iad_ and _ea_ get a preceeding _h-_ after _ní_:

* _Ní hé_ (he/it is not)
* _Ní hí_ (she/it is not)
* _Ní hiad_ (they are not)
* _Ní hea_ (it is not)


### When to use _gur_ & _gurb_

Use _gur_ before

* consonants:
  _Ceapaim gur múinteoir é_ (I think that he is a teacher)
* nouns that start with a vowel:
  _Deir sí gur aisteoir é_ (She says that he is an actor)
* prepositions:
  _Sílim gur leis a dheartháir atá sé_
  (I think that he is with his brother)
* prepositional pronouns:
  _Ceapaim gur liomsa é sin_ (I think that that is mine)
* the adverbs _ann_ and _ansin_:
  _Is dócha gur ansin a bheidh sé ar siúl_ (I suppose it will be happening there)

Use _gurb_ before

* adjectives that start with a vowel:
  _Cloisim gurb álainn an ghairdín í_ (I hear that it is a beautiful garden)
* the pronouns ea/é/í/iad/eisean/ise/iadsan:
  _Deir sí gurb é an duine is fearr sa rang é_ (She says that he is the best person in the class)
* adverbs that start with a vowel:
  _Deirtear gurb annamh a thagann sé_ (It is said that he rarely comes)


## Past & Conditional Tense Forms

The past/conditional forms add a séimhiú to the following word. There are two
versions of each past/conditional form:

* Before a consonant or before _fhl-_ or _fhr-_, use _ba_/_níor_/_ar_/_nár_/_gur_.
* Before a vowel or before _fh-_ and a vowel, use _b'_/_níorbh_/_arbh_/_nárbh_/_gurbh_.
