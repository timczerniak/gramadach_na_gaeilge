## Gender

In Irish, there are two genders, masculine and feminine. In many languages,
gender is explicitly indicated by articles (e.g. _le_/_la_ in french,
_der_/_die_/_das_ in German), but in Irish, genders are more implicit.

There are some ways to guess what gender a noun is from the word itself, but
there are exceptions. Sometimes, in order to be certain about its gender, you
need to know how nouns of each gender behave in various situations. Sometimes,
the only way to know is to look it up in a dictionary.

## Guessing gender from the word itself

As a general rule, if a noun ends with a broad vowel or consonant, it's probably
masculine, and if it ends with a slender vowel or consonant, it's probably
feminine.

There are also the following common patterns (though there are exceptions too):

### Masculine patterns

## The article before nouns in the nominative/accusative

There are two words for 'the' in Irish, _an_ and _na_.

**Singular** nouns use _an_ in the nominative/accusative. Putting _an_ before
nouns in the nominative & accusative cases causes initial mutations in 3
situations:

* For masculine nouns starting with a vowel, a _t-_ is prepended.
* Feminine nouns starting with a consonant (except d/t/s) are given a séimhiú.
* For feminine nouns starting with an _s_, a _t_ is prepended, but not if they
  start with _sc-_, _sf-_, _sm-_, _sp-_, or _st-_ (because it'd be too hard to
  pronounce).

**Plural** nouns use _na_ in the nominative/accusative. Putting _na_ before a
noun in the nominative/accusative only changes the noun if it starts with a
vowel, in which case you add a _h_ at the start.

Here's a table of examples for reference:

| Gender    | Starts with    | Singular        | Plural          |
| ----------| -------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Masculine | vowel          | an **t**-amhrán | na **h**amhráin |
|           | consonant      | an bord         | na boird        |
|           | **d** or **t** | an duine        | na daoine       |
|           | **s**          | an sos          | na sosanna      |
| Feminine  | vowel          | an iris         | na **h**irisí   |
|           | consonant      | an b**h**ean    | na mná          |
|           | **d** or **t** | an tine         | na tinnte       |
|           | **s**          | an **t**sráid   | na sráideanna   |


## Plural forms of nouns

There are many ways that plural nouns are formed from their singulars, and there
are so many ways, it's hard to make an easy guide. They could all be layed out
here, but it'd be quite daunting. Unfortunately you just have to get used to
plural forms over time.

Recognisable plural endings include:

* _-nna_, _-anna_, _-eanna_
* _-acha_, _-eacha_
* _í_, _-aí_
* _-ithe_

Some irregular plurals include:

* _bean_ &#8594; _mná_
* _dia_ &#8594; _déithe_
* _bó_ &#8594; _ba_
* _lá_ &#8594; _laethanta_
* _mí_ &#8594; _míonna_
* _teach_ &#8594; _tithe_
* _leaba_ &#8594; _leapacha_
* _talamh_ &#8594; _tailte_


## Looking up nouns in the dictionary

It's worth taking a minute to look at how nouns are listed in Irish-English
dictionaries.

* The listing title is always in the nominative singular (_ns_).
* A tilde is used to signify the word in _ns_ form, e.g. **~a** means the _ns_
  form with _-a_ added to the end.
* The following abbreviations are used:
  * _m_ (masculine)
  * _f_ (feminine)
  * _ns_ (nominative singular)
  * _gs_ (genitive singular)
  * _npl_ (nominative plural)
  * _gpl_ (genitive plural)

Here's an example for _súil_ (eye):

**súil**, _f._ (_gs._ & _npl._ **~e**, _gpl._ **súl**)

From this listing we can see that, for _súil_:

* it's feminine (_f._).
* The genitive singular and the nominative plural forms are both _súile_.
* The genative plural form is _súl_.
