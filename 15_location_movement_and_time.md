# Location, Movement & Time


## Location & Movement

The adverbs _síos_, _thíos_ and _aníos_ are usually used to refer to something
under the place where the speaker is.

The adverbs _suas_, _thuas_ and _anuas_ are usually used to refer to something
above the place where the speaker is.

The adverbs _síos_ and _suas_ are often used when referring to an uncertain
position.

## Adverbs of Time

The Adverb _riamh_ is used in the Aimsir Láithreach and the Aimsir Chaite. In
the Aimsir Fháistineach, however, _choíche_, _go brách_ and _go deo_ are used to
achieve the same meaning.

* _Ní raibh mé riamh sa Fhrainc._ (I was never in France.)
* _Ní bhfaighidh mé pas sa scrúdú sin choíche._ (I will never get a pass in that test.)
* _Ní fheicfidh mé go deo arís í!_ (I will never see it again.)


## Days of the Week

The days of the week are named like so:

* _an Luan_ (Monday)
* _an Mháirt_ (Tuesday)
* _an Chéadaoin_ (Wednesday)
* _an Déardaoin_ (Thursday)
* _an Aoine_ (Friday)
* _an Satharn_ (Saturday)
* _an Domhnach_ (Sunday)

In phrases:

* _Inniu an Luan._ (Today is Monday.)
* _Amárach an Mháirt._ (Tomorrow is Tuesday.)
* _Caitheann sé an Aoine lena mhac._ (He spends Friday with his son.)

_Dé_ is used when referring to a particular day that is just coming or just
gone. The day is in the genitive after _Dé_.

* _Beidh mé ar ais Dé Luain._ (I'll be back on Monday.)
* _D'fhág sí an tír maidin Déardaoin seo caite._ (She left the country last Thursday.)
* _Buailfidh mé isteach chugat Dé Máirt._ (I will meet you on Tuesday.)

It is not correct to ever put _an_ or _ar_ before _Dé_.

| Correct                                   | Incorrect                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| _Beidh mé an-ghnóthach Dé hAoine._        | _Beidh mé an-ghnóthach an Dé hAoine seo._  |
| _Beidh mé an-ghnóthach ar an Aoine._      |                                            |
| _Beidh an cluiche ar siúl Dé Sathairn._   | _Beidh an cluiche ar siúl ar Dé Sathairn._ |
| _Beidh an cluiche ar siúl ar an Satharn._ |                                            |

Note that the word _Dé_ is part of the word _Déardaoin_, and so _Dé_ is never put
before it.

The word _Dé_ is never given a séimhiú:

* _Beidh sí ar ais oíche **Dh**omhnaigh._
* _Beidh cóisir Chiara ar siúl oíche Dé Sathairn._

There is a choice after the word _oíche_. _Dé_ can be used or not.

* _Beidh an cheolchoirm ar siúl oíche Dé Sathairn._
* _Beidh an cheolchoirm ar siúl oíche **Sh**athairn._
