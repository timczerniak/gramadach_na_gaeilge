# Verbs: Imperative


The imperative is the command-form of a verb. That is, you use it when giving an
order ("Go there!", "Do that!", etc.). The Irish for the Imperative "mood" is
_An Modh Ordaitheach_.

There are two forms of the imperative. One form used when talking to a single
person, and one form used when talking to multiple people.


## Talking to a single person

When talking to a single person, you always just use the dictionary-form of the
verb. This is the case for all irregular verbs too. Some examples:

* _tar anseo_ (come here)
* _bris an fhuinneog_ (break the window)
* _bí ciúin_ (be quiet)
* _nigh do lámha_ (wash your hands)


## Talking to multiple people

When talking to multiple people, for most verbs you add _-igí_/_-aigí_ to the
singular form.

* _bris_ &#8594; _brisigí_
* _tóg_ &#8594; _tógaigí_
* _

If the verb ends in _-áil_ or _-áin_, remove the _i_ before the l or n, and add
_-aigí_.

* _marcáil_ &#8594; _marcálaigí_
* _taispeáin_ &#8594; _taispeánaigí_

For monosyllabic verbs that end with a fada vowel and _-igh_, the _-igh_ is
dropped and _-igí_ is added.

* _dóigh_ &#8594; _dóigí_
* _léigh_ &#8594; _léigí_

For all other verbs that end _-igh_, the _-igh_ is dropped and _-ígí_ is added.

* _nigh_ &#8594; _nígí_
* _suigh_ &#8594; _suígí_
* _ceannaigh_ &#8594; _ceannaígí_
* _bailigh_ &#8594; _bailígí_

For polysyllabic verbs that end with _-il_, _-in_, _-ir_ and _-is_, remove the
last vowel-cluster and add either _-ígí_ or _-aígí_, according to broad/slender.

* _ceangail_ &#8594; _ceanglaígí_
* _imir_ &#8594; _imrígí_
* _inis_ &#8594; _insígí_


## Negative

Put _ná_ in front of the verb. Put a _h_ at the start of the verb if it starts
with a vowel.

* _Ná bris é!_
* _Ná habair liom go bhfuil sé ar ais_
* _Ná himrígí peil ar an bpríomhbhóthar_


## Irregular verbs

There are 11 irregular verbs. Only 3 of them have irregular forms in the
second-person plural imperative:

* _bí_ &#8594; _bígí_
* _tabhair_ &#8594; _tugaigí_
* _tar_ &#8594; _tagaigí_
