# The Alphabet


Irish has a 23 letter alphabet. It has 18 of the 26 letters of the English
alphabet, plus 5 long (_fada_) vowels.

The 10 vowels are _a_, _á_, _e_, _é_, _i_, _í_, _o_, _ó_, _u_ & _ú_.

The 13 consonants are _b_, _c_, _d_, _f_, _g_, _h_, _l_, _m_, _n_, _p_, _r_,
_s_ & _t_.

The other 8 letters in the English alphabet (_j_, _k_, _q_, _v_, _w_, _x_, _y_ & _z_)
make appearances occasionally in words that are borrowed from other languages
(usually English), but they are rare and not regarded as part of the alphabet.
None of these letters can be lenited or eclipsed (see below).


## Broad (_Caol_) and Slender (_Leathan_)

The vowels are divided up into broad (_a_, _á_, _o_, _ó_, _u_, _ú_) and slender
(_e_, _é_, _i_, _í_).

When a consonant has a broad vowel beside it, it is called broad, and equally,
when it has a slender vowel beside it, it is called slender.


### _"Caol le caol, leathan le leathan"_

This phrase means 'broad with broad, slender with slender'. It is a general rule
for spelling, and it means that if there is a broad vowel on one side of a
consonant cluster, there must be a broad vowel on the other side. Equally, if
there is a slender vowel on one side of a consonant cluster, there must be a
slender vowel on the other side.

There are exceptions. Words made up of multiple other words joined together
(_comhfhocail_) can break this rule if the two words start and end with
different types of consonants. There are some other words that break the rule,
but they are very rare.


## Initial Mutations

There are two types of initial mutation, lenition (_séimhiú_) and eclipsis
(_urú_).


### Lenition / Séimhiú

This is when a _h_ is added after the first letter of a word and the sound of
the initial letter is aspirated. Only 9 of the 13 consonants can be lenited.
We'll call these **lenitable** or **séimhiú-able** consonants. Vowels can't be
lenited.

| Consonant | Lenited |
| --------- | ------- |
| b         | bh      |
| c         | ch      |
| d         | dh      |
| f         | fh      |
| g         | gh      |
| h         | --      |
| l         | --      |
| m         | mh      |
| n         | --      |
| p         | ph      |
| r         | --      |
| s         | sh      |
| t         | th      |


### Eclipsis / Urú

This is when a letter (or two) is added before the first letter of a word. Each
letter has a different letter that goes before it, and the sound of the initial
letter is replaced (or 'eclipsed') by the added letter(s). Only 7 of the 13
consonants can be eclipsed. We'll call these **eclipsable** or **urú-able**
consonants. Vowels can not be eclipsed.

| Consonant | Eclipsed |
| --------- | -------- |
| b         | mb       |
| c         | gc       |
| d         | nd       |
| f         | bhf      |
| g         | ng       |
| h         | --       |
| l         | --       |
| m         | --       |
| n         | --       |
| p         | bp       |
| r         | --       |
| s         | --       |
| t         | dt       |


### Other Mutations

Sometimes words that start with vowels will be preceeded by either _h_ or _n-_.
Often when a seimhiú is required it would be _h_ and when an urú is required it
would be _n-_, but this is not universal, and it usually depends on the
grammatical situation in question.

In certain circumstances, words that start with _s_ are preceeded by a _t_.
Again, this depends on the grammatical situation in question.
