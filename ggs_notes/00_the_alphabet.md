# The Alphabet


Irish has a 23 letter alphabet. It has 18 of the 26 letters of the English
alphabet, plus 5 long (_fada_) vowels.

The 10 vowels are _a_, _á_, _e_, _é_, _i_, _í_, _o_, _ó_, _u_ & _ú_.

The 13 consonants are _b_, _c_, _d_, _f_, _g_, _h_, _l_, _m_, _n_, _p_, _r_,
_s_ & _t_.

The other 8 letters in the English alphabet (_j_, _k_, _q_, _v_, _w_, _x_, _y_ & _z_)
make appearances occasionally in words that are borrowed from other languages
(usually English), but they are rare and not regarded as part of the alphabet.
None of these letters can be lenited or eclipsed (see below).


## Slender (_Caol_) and Broad (_Leathan_)

The vowels are divided up into slender (_e_, _é_, _i_, _í_) and broad
(_a_, _á_, _o_, _ó_, _u_, _ú_).

When a consonant has a slender vowel beside it, it is called a slender consonant.
Equally, when a consonant has a broad vowel beside it, it is called a broad consonant.


### _"Caol le caol, leathan le leathan"_

This phrase means 'slender with slender, broad with broad'. It is a general
spelling rule, and it means that if there is a slender vowel on one side of a
consonant cluster, there must be a slender vowel on the other side. Equally, if
there is a broad vowel on one side of a consonant cluster, there must be a
broad vowel on the other side.

There are exceptions. Words made up of multiple other words joined together
(_comhfhocail_) can break this rule if the two words start and end with
different types of consonants. There are some other words that break the rule,
but they are rare.


## Initial Mutations

There are two types of initial mutation, lenition (_séimhiú_) and eclipsis
(_urú_).


### Lenition / Séimhiú

_Séimhiú_ means "softening". This is when a _h_ is added after a letter and the
sound of it is lenited (or aspirated, or softened). Only 9 of the 13 consonants
can be lenited, which we'll call **lenitable** or **séimhiú-able**.
Vowels can't be lenited.

| Consonant | Lenited |
| --------- | ------- |
| b         | bh      |
| c         | ch      |
| d         | dh      |
| f         | fh      |
| g         | gh      |
| h         | --      |
| l         | --      |
| m         | mh      |
| n         | --      |
| p         | ph      |
| r         | --      |
| s         | sh      |
| t         | th      |


### Eclipsis / Urú

_Urú_ means "eclipsis". This is when a letter (or two) is added before the first
letter of a word. Each initial letter has a different letter that goes before it,
and the sound of the initial letter is replaced (or 'eclipsed') by the added
letter(s). Only 7 of the 13 consonants can be eclipsed. We'll call these
**eclipsable** or **urú-able** consonants. Vowels can not be eclipsed.

| Consonant | Eclipsed |
| --------- | -------- |
| b         | mb       |
| c         | gc       |
| d         | nd       |
| f         | bhf      |
| g         | ng       |
| h         | --       |
| l         | --       |
| m         | --       |
| n         | --       |
| p         | bp       |
| r         | --       |
| s         | --       |
| t         | dt       |


### Other Mutations

Sometimes, when a séimhiú is required, words that start with vowels will be
preceeded by a _h_. This depends on the grammatical situation in question.

Sometimes, when an urú is required, words that start with vowels will be
preceeded by a _n-_. Again, this depends on the grammatical situation in question.

In certain circumstances, words that start with _s_ are preceeded by a _t_.
But yet again, this depends on the grammatical situation in question.
